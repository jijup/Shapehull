# Shapehull

The repo contains the implementation (executable) of the paper, Jiju Peethambaran, Ramanathan Muthuganapathy, "Reconstruction of Water-tight Surfaces through Delaunay Sculpting", Computer Aided Design, 2015.

The software provides a Qt based interface to load the point set in .xyz format and displays the resultant surface when the algorithm is run.
It also provides the computational time incurred in different stages of the algorithm. We have provided a few input data in .xyz format which the users may try out.
